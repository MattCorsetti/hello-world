# hello-world
A practice repository to help familiarize myself with GitHub

About me:
I'm a first year Ph.D. student in the Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology
at the University of Rochester. I am fascinated by machine-learning and statistical analysis.
I'm hoping to receive my Ph.D. in 5-6 years and I would like to eventually work for a tech
firm and use state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

Commit Message to Describe Changes to README.md:
The tutorial asked us to write an "about me" section in the README.md file so as to better
understand what a commit is.
